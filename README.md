## Intro
A terminal-based NumPy implementation of the game "2048" originally created by Gabriele Cirulli. Frontend developed using curses.

## Usage
- Basic usage: `python main.py` launches the game in "interactive" mode.
- Additional arguments can be passed, use `python main.py --help` to view them.

## Requirements
Install requirements using pip or your favorite Python package manager.
These packages are required for executing the code in this repository:
- `numpy`
- For windows systems: `windows-curses`
